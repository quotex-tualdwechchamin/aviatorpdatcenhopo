## Is Quotex Halal?

The answer to this question is not straightforward. There are different
opinions on the matter, and it ultimately depends on the individual\'s
interpretation of Islamic law.

Some scholars argue that Quotex is haram because it involves gambling.
Gambling is prohibited in Islam, as it is seen as a form of
exploitation. Others argue that Quotex is halal because it is a form of
investing, and investing is not prohibited in Islam.

The majority of scholars, however, believe that Quotex is halal if it is
used for trading purposes and not for gambling. This is because trading
is seen as a legitimate way to make money, while gambling is not.
